PKT is a fork of bitcoin with it's own genesis block, it's designed for mesh networking. It uses [PacketCrypt](https://github.com/cjdelisle/PacketCrypt) proof of work which requires internet bandwidth in order to mine and it has a *network steward* address which receives 20% of every coinbase.

## What is a network steward?
The network steward is an address which gets 20% of every new block-mine so that the developers can <s>have lamborghinis</s> finance the building of mesh network technology. Unlike a premine or founder's fee, the recipient of the network steward payout can be changed by a PoS vote.

## What can you do with it?
Not a whole lot at the moment, there's a [text based wallet](https://github.com/cjdelisle/pkt-wallet) but in order to use it, you need to run a [full node](https://github.com/cjdelisle/pktd).

## So you wanna mine
Yeah, so there's like 2 options, either you can mine in a pool, or you can setup your own pool and mine in a pool. PacketCrypt algorithm is such that in order to be effective at mining, you need to (gasp) collaborate with other miners. So you can either run a whole bunch of your own miners which collaborate in your own pool, or you can join an existing pool.
